Shortest Optimal Route Path

Description: The project aims to develop an algorithm that finds the shortest optimal route between two points in a given map or network. It solves the problem of determining the most efficient path from a starting point to a destination, considering factors such as distance, time, or cost. The project utilizes graph-based algorithms and techniques to calculate the shortest path.
